This is a nuspec. It mostly adheres to https://docs.nuget.org/create/Nuspec-Reference. Chocolatey uses a special version of NuGet.Core that allows us to do more than was initially possible. As such there are certain things to be aware of:

* the package xmlns schema url may cause issues with nuget.exe
* Any of the following elements can ONLY be used by choco tools - projectSourceUrl, docsUrl, mailingListUrl, bugTrackerUrl, packageSourceUrl, provides, conflicts, replaces
* nuget.exe can still install packages with those elements but they are ignored. Any authoring tools or commands will error on those elements
-->

<!-- You can embed software files directly into packages, as long as you are not bound by distribution rights. -->
<!-- * If you are an organization making private packages, you probably have no issues here -->
<!-- * If you are releasing to the community feed, you need to consider distribution rights. -->
<!-- Do not remove this test for UTF-8: if “Ω” doesn’t appear as greek uppercase omega letter enclosed in quotation marks, you should use an editor that supports UTF-8, not this one. -->

    <description>
diff-pdf is a tool for visually comparing two PDFs.

It takes two PDF files as arguments. By default, its only output is its return
code, which is 0 if there are no differences and 1 if the two PDFs differ. If
given the `--output-diff` option, it produces a PDF file with visually
highlighted differences:

```
$ diff-pdf --output-diff=diff.pdf a.pdf b.pdf
```

Another option is to compare the two files visually in a simple GUI, using
the `--view` argument:

```
$ diff-pdf --view a.pdf b.pdf
```

This opens a window that lets you view the files' pages and zoom in on details.
It is also possible to shift the two pages relatively to each other using
Ctrl-arrows (Cmd-arrows on MacOS). This is useful for identifying translation-only differences.

See the output of `$ diff-pdf --help` for complete list of options.
